## Note

The MTO-Platform (MToP) has incorporated the relevant algorithm at *"MTO/Algorithm/Multi-task/Multi-population/MTES-KG/MTES-KG.m"* and provides convenient utility functions. We highly recommend using it for code running. [https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform](https://github.com/intLyc/MTO-Platform)

The real-world applications covered in the paper have also been uploaded to the MTO-Platform
